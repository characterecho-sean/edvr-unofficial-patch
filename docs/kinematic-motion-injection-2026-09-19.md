# Kinematic-sourced motion-vector injection: a design

## Status

- **State:** DECIDED DIRECTION, 2026-09-19 (Sean): the final design for
  DLSS motion is engine-level injection from KinematicRig truth, not
  draw-call interpretation in the render pipeline. Draw-call identity
  and motion estimation are ruled out as a class (see below). The
  DLSS-path MV replacement (surface 2) is the end goal; EDVR's own
  temporal pass (surface 1) is the diagnostic stepping stone that proves
  the injected MVs are right before they touch DLSS history.
- **Open:** phase 0 is PARTLY RESOLVED offline after Sean's 2026-09-19
  21:23 review (settlement doc, same-time entry): the 20:52 flight's "hash
  stable across 1.4M calls" was never established (transition cap 8192 with
  1.44M overflowed, no hash-only counter), and +0x268 is a render-config
  hash that never reads the transform (FUN_14433C750) — retracted as a
  stasis signal. The 21:58 offline trace resolved collection+0x18 as a
  backing-owner pointer (ctor FUN_14430A060 param_3, single writer) and
  mapped the transform chain (FUN_144331300 LOD evaluator ->
  FUN_14433DB20 world updater; epoch pair collection+0x90 vs record+0x1B8
  as change-signal candidate). Still open: owner == rig proof (named
  runtime discriminator ready), job-cost remeasure with the detailed
  observer disabled and job-3 hooked. No per-record identity,
  pixel-ownership, or stasis claim survives without that work.
- **Ruled out (inherited, do not re-propose):** draw-shape memo identity
  (~96% misnaming); pool-slot identity (repacks); 3x3 SAD camera-vs-body
  match (self-confirming); estimating hidden-bone spin from the pool.

## Premise

EDVR's temporal pass already composes its motion-vector field from
per-class motion sources (screen_motion, weapon_motion, celestial_motion,
mesh_motion, object_probe). Each source computes exact motion for one
object family. This design adds a **kinematic source** fed by engine
truth instead of GPU-side estimation, writing into the same MV field the
pass already hands to NGX.

Engine-level injection replaces the identity and motion problems, not the
coverage problem: which pixels a record owns still comes from its world
bounds projected and depth-gated. Do not let "engine level" read as "no
screen-space work".

## What the engine provides (from the settlement-flicker arc)

- Exact per-node world transforms every frame: the traversal
  FUN_144312040 (RVA 0x4312040) recomposes parent x child 3x4 matrices
  per node, recursing children at record+0x2A8/+0x2B0. Reaches the
  hidden skinning bone that defeated pool-based estimation.
- Current-frame record transform: 3x4 at record+0x130..0x16C, view
  products at record+0xF0..0x12C; world bounds at record+0xB0..0xEC.
- NOT provided, after the 2026-09-19 review (settlement doc 21:23
  entry): a proven stasis/change signal. record+0x268 is a
  render-config hash that never reads the transform (FUN_14433C750);
  render-record+0x688 is the engine's intra-frame evaluation sequencer;
  record+0x2C0 is a shared render-graph view object, not a per-record
  predicate. The transform/dirty-state dependency chain is an open
  offline item.
- Identity is NOT solved by node pointer alone: 2633 records share 510
  node pointers (~5 records per node), so per-record history needs a
  finer key; and projected bounds + depth gating do not uniquely own a
  mesh's pixels. Both must be resolved before any MV overwrite.

## Where injection makes sense

| Class | Signal | Injected MV | Expected win |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proven-static settlement geometry | NONE PROVEN YET (was: +0x268 hash — retracted) | exact zero object motion | kills settlement shimmer/ghosting at the source |
| Rigid movers (stations, ships) | per-frame delta of record+0x130..0x16C | exact rigid MV | closes tier-2's up-to-8-frame staleness; reaches hidden-bone spin |
| Skinned/particle/smoke | none reliable | inject nothing | avoids the smoke-voids regression class |

Zero OBJECT motion always means the camera/head term stays in the final
vector — the injection composes object motion into the existing camera
motion, never replaces the whole vector.

## Injection surface (singular, after the 2026-09-19 review)

There is only one: **EDVR's own temporal pass**. NGX already consumes
EDVR's own MV texture (e.dlMv at the dlaaEvaluate/fsr3Evaluate hand-off
in temporal_pass.cpp) — the "game's DLSS path" surface was imaginary;
the diagnostic MV view and DLSS consume the same composition. A
kinematic_motion module mirroring mesh_motion's interface: per frame,
walk hooked collections, compute deltas, write object-motion deltas over
each record's verified pixel ownership, depth-gated (tier-1 lesson: a
mover's interior still ghosts without depth consistency). Proven right
with the existing temporal_aa_debug MV view before it ships.

## Phasing

- **Phase 0 (offline, current):** writer -> collection -> collection+0x18
  RESOLVED offline 2026-09-19 (settlement doc 21:58 entry): +0x18 is a
  backing-owner pointer written once by the collection ctor FUN_14430A060;
  the collection aliases the owner's scene-graph arrays. Owner == rig is
  unproven behind the computed dispatcher; a two-dereference runtime check
  (*(owner+0x348) == collection and owner+0x380 == 4) settles it in the
  next instrumented flight and would retire the planned submission hook.
  Transform/dirty chain mapped: FUN_144331300 LOD evaluator ->
  FUN_14433DB20 world updater (record+0x170 translation, +0x240 center,
  +0xF0/+0x1C0 current/previous bounds); the collection+0x90 vs
  record+0x1B8 epoch pair is a genuine change-signal candidate. Remaining
  offline: remeasure job cost with the detailed observer disabled and
  job-3 hooked. No build before this lands.
- **Phase 1:** static-zero object-motion injection, config key,
  depth-gated, settlements only, gated on a PROVEN stasis signal from
  phase 0. One hook (traversal or collection walk), one compute shader,
  one motion module. Diagnosable with the temporal_aa_debug MV view.
- **Phase 2:** rigid-delta injection for movers (per-frame).
- A wrong MV in DLSS history is worse than none; each phase ships only
  with a measured before/after.

## Costs and risks

- CPU: a few hundred record reads per frame (trivial). GPU: one bounded
  compute pass per eye.
- Wrong-MV artifacts: the biggest risk. Mitigation requires per-record
  identity finer than the node pointer, verified pixel ownership, depth
  gating, and an engine-proven change signal — none of which exists yet;
  that is what phase 0 is for.
- Identity drift on collection realloc: key on record identity resolved
  in phase 0, never on the record address (the collection vector can
  realloc).
- Environment dependency to state at flight time: VR runtime, headset,
  per-eye render size, DLSS version, and the fixed record-table sizes.
